<p>Dear Medha,</p>

<h2> A Little Note from Paul</h2>

	<p>		Hi Medha. So normally I like to write handwritten letters for stuff like this,
	but given the current circumstances and the fact that I don't know you address, I have
	chosen to write this instead. Getting to know you over the last few months has been amazing.
	You have the biggest heart of anyone I know. You literally give your all to Freyja and Thora, Ni Lar,
	your RISE women, and really anyone you interact with. Now, you are going down to El Paso to help immigrants
	adjust to life in the states. I hope you realize most people don't do these things. Most people just
	donate money to a charity and call it a day. Some people don't do anything to help others at all.
	So I hope you realize how special you are. Because even though you might not think it, I and all the other people 
	in your life (or at least the smart people in you life) know you are.</p>

	<p>		The circumstances that led to us to get to know eachother are a bit abnormal to say the least. But who cares?
		If anything, I think us spending time together (virtually) forced us to take things slow and just talk. I had 
		so much fun reading your texts about some genetics concepts that I could not really understand. It was a blast
		watching Tiger King and Casa De Papel with you, even the shitty third season. I love our zoom dates, doing 
		homework with you, and staying up till 1:30AM playing the console version of the board game Ticket to Ride. You 
		are the only person I know who would stay up into the early morning to try learn binary, octal, hexidecimal, and
		how covert between all three and decimal. I love how you always gave me plenty of material to read and kept me 
		from overworking myself. You really make me (and so many others) feel special, and your impact on other people's lives
		(especially my own) cannot be understated. 
	</p>

	<p>
			I look forward to getting to know you even more, and hopefully in person sometime soon. But even if circumstances don't allow
		for that, I'm totally fine. Because I know if the world was ending, there is one person who I want to see, in person, virtually,
		or whatever.
	</p>

	<p>
		Happy Bleeping Birthday Medha!!!!!!
	</p>

	<p>
		All the best,
	</p>

	<h2>Paul, Tu Helado, Spidy, Paulie, Paula, y tu mejor amigo</h2>
